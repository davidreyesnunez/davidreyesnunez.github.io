   <p>My name is David Reyes. I am 26 years old.I was born on July 16,1992. I was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco and at the age of four I moved to DFW with my Mother.Growing up In the U.S I was apart of the Scouts. Some of my most fond memories include Rock climbing,Kayaking Hiking and being thrown into the wilderness with a Blade and flint.Also we would go on high Adventures. On one occasion we were given the priviledge to spend the night on a historic battle ship used in World War 2.Given the change I enjoy slow dancing  ,exercising and exploring the wild. The school of hard knocks has be one of my greatist teachers.When I was younger I strived to be an Entrepreneur selling limonade at a verry early age in front of my house, later on I sold food to my classmates and started my own small buisness printing the adress on the curb of peoples homes. I returned to my motherland by way of choice at 22 and have worked as an English Teacher at several institutions as well as privately. My hobbies include  exercising,reading,cycling,and dancing to the beat of the bass. I dicided to join Hola Code when I heard a truth that impacted me "Talent is everywhere but opportunity is not".I take being in Hola code as a priveileg which I hope to merit. like a boss
